# CountriesOfTheWorld

The Codable protocol is used to grab some JSON data about countries of the world. The countries are displayed in a table, which is sorted alphabetically with functional programming and extensions. A detailed view of each country shows a map, flag, and random attributes that are layed out programmitically. Accessiblity is taken into consideration with font scalability and readable margins for iPad layouts.
